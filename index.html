<h2>Daily Questions
</h2>

<h3>Monday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>
        Today, I made solid progress toward setting up the foundation for the new brief. I created and organised my FigJam boards, which will serve as my documentation. I also began building my blog website, which will be used to document my process, and reflect on my sprints. Getting these platforms setup early puts me in a good position to stay on top of the brief.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to dive into research and start brainstorming potential social enterprise ideas. I’ll begin by exploring existing social enterprises for inspiration, identifying common themes, and taking note of opportunities in the market.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>At the moment there are no blockers.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I completed the Bootcamp formative task, which involved designing a website for a fictional cupcake shop. This exercise helped me refresh and apply key web design skills. It was a useful way to ease back into practical work while also reinforcing fundamental coding techniques.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to shift focus back to the social enterprise project by brainstorming interview questions for my upcoming user research. These questions will aim to uncover insights about the audience I want to target, their needs, and existing pain points. I’ll also start thinking about how to structure the interviews to keep them open and exploratory.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>My biggest blocker at the moment is that my personal laptop has broken, and I’m currently relying on campus computers. This has made things more stressful and disrupted my usual workflow, especially when it comes to accessing files I normally use. As a result, I’m feeling a bit behind and less productive than I’d like to be.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I focused on the research phase of my social enterprise project by brainstorming and finalising my interview questions. I spent time thinking about what insights I need from participants in order to better understand their needs. I gained feedback and refined the wording to ensure the questions are open-ended and non-leading, allowing for more valuable responses.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I will begin conducting interviews with participants. My goal is to gather their perspectives and personal experiences that can lead me to a problem. I’ll focus on recording responses accurately, so I can later identify patterns and pain points.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>At the moment there are no blcokers.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I conducted interviews with three participants as part of my primary research for the social enterprise brief. Each conversation provided valuable insights into their experiences,pain points, and needs. I made sure to take detailed notes, and ask follow-up questions to dig deeper into their responses. After the interviews, I reviewed and analysed the feedback to extract several key problems that my social enterprise could potentially address.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to use the insights from today’s interviews to finalise a clear problem statement. I’ll ensure that it reflects both the user needs and the underlying issues from my secondary research. Once the problem statement is refined, I’ll begin developing my target audience. This will include demographics, behaviours, motivations, and pain points, helping me better understand who I’m designing for.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>At the moment there are no blcokers.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Friday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I made progress on two key areas. First, I began brainstorming and outlining my target audience for the social enterprise project. I considered their demographics, values, behaviours, needs, and pain points.
    In addition to that, I started ideation for the Type Here brief. I explored different key words and I want to convey. It was a productive balance of both conceptual and practical design thinking today.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I’ll continue developing the Type Here brief further by iterating ideas. I’ll also continue with ideating potential solutions that cater to the audience I began to design.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>At the moment there are no blockers.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Weekly Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What went well?</li>
    <p>This week was the beginning of Term 2 and the start of a new brief focused on creating a social enterprise. I was able to understand the brief clearly and had a good idea of the tasks that needed to be completed each week. I quickly came up with ideas for areas of interest and developed relevant questions to ask participants, which gave me a solid starting point.</p>
    <li>What didn’t go well?</li>
    <p>Unfortunately, my laptop broke on the second day of class, which caused quite a bit of stress and uncertainty. This unexpected setback left me feeling a little behind in my work and disrupted my usual workflow.</p>
    <li>What can be improved?</li>
    <p>One thing I can improve on is reaching out more to lecturers when I need clarification. Instead of sitting with confusion or uncertainty, I need to be more proactive in asking questions to stay on track.</p>
    <li>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</li>
    <p>Next week, I will aim to communicate more with my lecturers to clarify any parts of the brief or tasks I’m unsure about. On top of that, I’ll work on solidifying my target audience and start ideating solutions to my problem statement.</p>
