<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I presented my WIP presentation and received valuable feedback, particularly around my solution.

This will help me create a more focused and relevant solution.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to conduct a competitor analysis of existing inventory management apps. This will help me understand current solutions in the market, identify weaknesses, in order to push my solution further.</p>

<h3>Friday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>

This gave me insight into how I can differentiate my solution and better serve small business owners. I also attended the Radical Future Designers workshop.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Next, I plan to solidify my solution based on my insights, and then move on to creating lo-fi prototypes to begin shaping the user experience.</p>

<h2>Weekly Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What went well?</li>
    <p>My research went really well and gave me strong insights into the real problems faced by small business owners. This helped me narrow down and define a clear, specific problem to solve. My WIP presentation also went well, I received valuable feedback that helped clarify my direction moving forward.</p>
    <li>What didn’t go well?</li>
    <p>After completing my WIP, I lost some motivation and didn’t make as much progress as I could have. It was a bit of a pause on the assignment.</p>
    <li>What can be improved?</li>
    <p>I need to work on maintaining steady progress even after big milestones like the WIP. Keeping up the momentum will help me stay on track and avoid falling behind.</p>
    <li>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</li>
    <p>Next week, I need to start picturing how my solution will work from a user experience perspective. I’ll begin developing a lo-fi prototype to visualise and test the flow of my idea.</p>
