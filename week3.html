<h2>Daily Questions
</h2>

<h3>Monday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I began planning the structure of my lo-fi prototype. I sketched out initial ideas for how I want each page to look, focusing on user flow and navigation. I researched other food-saving apps, particularly Too Good To Go. I drew inspiration from its interface. This gave me ideas on how to create an engaging and user-friendly experience that communicates the platform quickly and clearly.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I’ll move into Figma to begin bringing my lo-fi wireframes to life. I plan to start laying out the core pages—such as the homepage, inventory, expiring, and batch sizes. A major focus will be on the login experience, ensuring it’s simple and welcoming.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I finalised my lo-fi prototype in Figma. I added in placeholder content and carefully laid out each element on its page to reflect the intended user journey. I ensured consistency in design elements such as spacing, typography, and button placement to create a cohesive interface. This process helped give me a clearer picture of how users will interact with the app.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to begin testing my prototype to evaluate its usability and overall flow. I’ll observe how users navigate through the app, paying attention to any moments of confusion. My goal is to determine whether the experience feels seamless. Based on user feedback, I’ll identify areas for improvement.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I conducted user testing on my lo-fi prototype. Based on their feedback, I made several key improvements. One significant update was enhancing the login experience to make it more user-friendly. I also decided to remove the recipes page, as it caused confusion and didn’t align clearly with the app’s core purpose. These changes helped streamline the user flow and ensure a more focused and seamless experience.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I’ll shift my focus to developing the brand’s tone of voice and making initial branding decisions. This will include exploring how I want the brand to feel. I’ll begin defining the colour palettes, typography, and photography that align with the brand’s values and target audience.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I created two moodboards to explore different directions for expressing my brand’s tone of voice and visual identity. Each moodboard captured a different aesthetic, helping me compare which approach best aligns with my target audience and brand values. I also made progress on my design strategy document, mapping out its structure and starting to add key content, such as target audience and design challenge.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>I’ll focus on developing the Type Here brief to finalise my concept and refine my ideation. I’ll revisit my core concepts to ensure my ideation is clear. This will involve sketching up my ideation.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Friday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I received feedback on my Type Here brief and used it to refine and strengthen my concept. The input helped me clarify my direction and identify areas that needed more development. Following this, I expanded on my idea through further sketching and ideation, exploring different ways to bring the concept to life visually.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I’ll return to my design strategy document and continue building it out. I plan to develop more detailed content for each section, including research and brand personality.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>
