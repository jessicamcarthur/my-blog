<h2>Daily Questions
</h2>

<h3>Monday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Today, I began inputting my presentation slides with content, ensuring the structure clearly communicates my concept and process. I also started designing the visual layout of the slides to align with my current brand identity, using the same typography, colour, and visuals.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I plan to focus on refining my branding elements, specifically working on developing a more logos. I’ll also experiment with different colour palettes to make sure they effectively convey the tone and personality of the brand.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>Following Simon’s feedback, I revisited my logo ideas and explored more literal interpretations, including illustrative elements that communicate the brand’s tone of voice. I sketched multiple concepts and digitally mocked up a few to assess their impact and visual harmony within the brand identity.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I intend to create a hi-fi prototype that visually represents my app in a more polished way. This prototype will be included in my presentation to give a realistic sense of the final product and help strengthen my overall pitch.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I concentrated on my Design Strategy document, expanding the content. I refined the wording of my problem statement, detailed the insights from my research, and elaborated on how my solution works. I also integrated visuals to support the narrative.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>Tomorrow, I will shift to practicing my proposal presentation to ensure I’m well prepared and confident in delivering it. I’ll also be presenting it to receive any feedback.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Thursday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I delivered my proposal presentation, communicating my concept, design process, and research findings. After the presentation, I took on feedback from peers and lecturers, which I used to refine my Design Strategy document.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>With the presentation complete, I will transition to working on the Type Here brief. My focus will be on developing an initial interactive prototype that aligns with the concept and explore the coding techniques Simon showed us.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h3>Friday</h3>
<ul>
    <li>What did I accomplish today?</li>
    <p>I dedicated the day to working on the Type Here brief, diving into development using Matter.js. I started building out my interactive concept, experimenting with physics-based interactions and motion. I focused on getting the core functionality working.</p>
    <li>What will I do tomorrow?</li>
    <p>I’ll continue refining the prototype, enhancing the interactivity.</p>
    <li>Are there any blockers?</li>
    <p>No.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Weekly Questions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>What went well?</li>
    <p>This week I made strong progress on developing my brand identity. I refined my logo concepts, explored new directions based on feedback, and successfully integrated these elements into my presentation. The visual design is now more representative of my concept. I also felt confident and well-prepared for my proposal presentation, which I delivered successfully. Receiving and implementing feedback helped me further strengthen my overall direction.</p>
    <li>What didn’t go well?</li>
    <p>Although the week was productive, I fell behind on my Design Strategy document. As a result, I had to use time on Friday to finalise the document. This reduced the amount of time I had to focus on prototyping and experimenting with interactive outcomes, putting me slightly behind where I wanted to be with that brief.</p>
    <li>What can be improved?</li>
    <p>Time management across overlapping deadlines needs to be improved to ensure each project receives adequate attention without sacrificing progress. I also want to avoid last-minute work that cuts into time allocated for other briefs.</p>
    <li>What actions will I take for the next sprint?</li>
    <p>Set clearer daily goals for each project to avoid lapping over and ensure steady progress across both briefs.</p>
</ul>
